	<p>Hello! I'm Ricky. I'm a fourth year design student at Binghamton University's Harpur College of Arts and Sciences.<p>
	<br>
	<p>I have a multidisciplined background in graphic design, fine arts, and medical sciences. I am currently refining <br> my skills to be complete designer in UX/UI, layout design, and product design. I am currently taking ARTS 486, <br> or Computer Graphics, as my special studio project to refine my HTML/CSS/Java in order to pursue my goals <br> of becoming a complete designer.</p>
	<br>
	<p>My goal is to become a nursing educator, and to become an advocate for nursing education.</p>
