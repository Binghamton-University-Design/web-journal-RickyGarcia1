	    </div>

	    <p> Throughout the galaxy, there are a great many that have done their part to ensure her safety... and many of them go unrecognized </p>
	    <p> The likes of Luke Skywalker, the Grand Army of the Republic, the Jedi- all take part in the grand story of the universe </p>
	    <p> However, the Star Wars Universe has its unsung heroes, and its counterparts that also impact the main story that we know and love. The history of the Mandalorians, the Pyke Syndicate, the Kaminoans (who are indirectly responsible for the creation of the Grand Army of the Republic). There is so much to unpack in the greater Star Wars Universe. 
	    <p>The Star Wars story is even stretched out in comic books and video games. Video games such as Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars: Fallen Order show the effects of people’s lives during the Galactic Civil War. </p>
	    <p> Fallen Orders follows a teenager who faces sudden death because he is now exposed as a person of interest because he is a Jedi, who are on the hunt after the collapse of the Republic. Battlefront II follows an Imperial defector who seeks to atone for her sins for aiding and abetting in the destruction of countless star systems as a pawn of the Empire. </p>
	    <p> There are now shows such as The Mandalorian and the Book of Boba Fett, which are new additions to the Star Wars story. The Mandalorian works great as a standalone story. However, Star Wars fans that have followed the lore since the very beginning will understand why things are. For example, seasoned fans will understand why the galaxy is like the wild west, and what Mandalorians are (because they are introduced and explained in Star Wars: Clone Wars). They will also understand certain references mentioned in the show that are very well hidden in other media. For example, there’s a scene that mentions Operation Cinder. 
	    <p>However, a casual fan wouldn’t know what Operation Cinder is because it is exclusively mentioned in Battlefront II. For those who get the reference, they will begin to realize how big of a world Star Wars really is. This is the source of inspiration for this. Picking up a show like The Mandalorian is like reading a random chapter from a book. Maybe you will get lucky and get a good story out of one chapter out of many. However, without a direct reference and timeline of what is going on in the universe, eventually you will get stuck. </p>
		<p>Additionally, there are much more complex concepts that must be shared to experience this series fully. This includes the concept of the Jedi religion, the fall of Mandalore, the rareness of Grogu’s species and what that means for the Star Wars universe.  All this falls into the Star Wars lore. The one way I feel that this can be bridged is through a complete and cohesive timeline. Of course, the timeline will start where it all begins, in my opinion: the prequel trilogy. From there, a web of lore can sprout and be created until we finish into the sequel trilogy, where it all comes together. </p>
		<p>This chronology is dedicated to the unsung heroes. To the ones who make up the universe just like any other spotlight character </p>
