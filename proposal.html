		      <h1>Star Wars Story Holocron: Conspiracy</h1>
		    </div>
		      <br> 

		   	<p> An interesting idea that was explored in the sequel Star Wars trilogy is the return of the Galactic Empire, <br> also known as the First Order. The resemblance of both the Imperial Army and the First Order is remarkably <br> similar, from the armor, to even the name of the soldiers- Stormtroopers. Even the concept of Stormtrooper <br> designations are inherently the same. </p>

		    <br> 

			<p> The point of making is that there is a reason that these two are similar. It was planned. As we find out, <br> Emperor Palpatine created a Contingency Plan to rebuild the Empire should the Rebellion Alliance <br> manage to successfully disintegrate the organization. This is not the first time we’ve seen Palpatine’s <br> genius as we learn that he orchestrated the Clone Wars to rise in the political arena. </p>

			<br> 

			<p> So here’s the juice of the proposal: <p>

			<p> Throughout the prequel trilogies, the animated series, anthologies, and other spin-offs, the rise of the Empire <br> was hinted.It’s easier for viewers to catch it as we see the entire story at multiple perspectives. However, <br> these hints are almost always covered up, or dodged entirely much to the heroes’ chagrin. The was this one <br> point in Star Wars history where the whole plot was inches away from being exposed: the Clones themselves. <br> High ranking soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic found evidence that they were programmed from <br> birth to be part of something more greater (more sinister, but they did not know that). However, Palpatine’s <br> forces quickly put the investigation to rest. A handful of characters in the universe became loose ends to the <br> plot, but were also shut down. </p>

			<br> 

			<p> My story follows an old wanderer who has followed the plot from the start, and the timeline starts at the <br> collapse of the Empire. He created his own conspiracy theory. He’s an anti-Imperial, and a scrapper and was <br> aware of how suspicious the transition the Republic had to becoming an Empire. His first idea was that <br> Palpatine sabotaged the Republic from the inside. Of course, people thought he was just another lunatic. <br> In one of his scavenging trips, he finds an old Republic cruiser that was shot down as a result of Order 66, <br> (an executive order to mark and execute Jedi for treason). Mind you, the wanderer is a brilliant technology <br>  expert. He revives a shutdown droid from the ship, and it glitches and accidentally opens up an encrypted <br> database full of the secrets that he knew, deep down, were true. </p>

			<br> 

			<p> From there, he decides to embark on a long journey to try to make more sense of what was presented to him. <br> He felt like he was barely scratching the surface, and that there’s more to come. The Empire is coming back. </p>

			<p> I wanted to create a fan story that serves an anthology that shows a grand conspiracy that spans throughout <br> all of Star Wars, and connect them all. This story is inspired by Star Wars: Clone Wars episode, “Conspiracy,” <br> and the Star Wars video game, Fallen Order. </p>

			<br> 

			<p> The layout of the website will resemble a holocron. If not familiar, a holocron is a device that contains encrypted <br> information and can only be opened with the power of the Force. The wanderer does not know he’s a force <br> sensitive individual...yet. This website is a database of his thoughts, and his story on how his journey is going. <br> It will be like a captain’s log, or a journey entry. Within the entries are information he’s gathered that support his <br> claim on the greater conspiracy, and he asks the bigger questions no one is asking. My hope is to connect the dots <br> of the Star Wars conspiracy myself through this character. </p>

			<br> 

			<p> Thank you for reading, and May the Force be with you. </p>
