	            Star Wars has exponentially grown since its introduction in the 1970s. What was originally intended to be a trilogy has blown up to introduce a prequel and a sequel trilogy. What is more amazing is that Star Wars is now tethering all generations, from Gen X to Gen Z, to become fans through the creation of new stories that make up the Star Wars Universe. An example that comes to mind is the development of Star Wars: Clone Wars, which released in 2008 and concluded in the summer of 2021. This storyline dives deeper into the characters that were introduced in the prequel trilogy and introduces new characters that play a pivotal role during the Clone Wars, a galactic war that spanned in between the second and third prequel movie (Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith). Star Wars: Clone Wars also expands on the lore of Star Wars, explaining why Anakin Skywalker is so important, the corruption of the Jedi, and even looking into the perspective of the adversaries. This is also further expanded in another series, Star Wars Rebels, which explores the lives of the people once the Empire rose to power after the third prequel movie. Furthermore, two anthology movies were released, highlighting other events that bridge the prequel and sequel trilogies. In the original trilogy, we learn that the Rebels stole the Death Star plans, but we do not know how. The movie, Rogue One, answers those questions, and even depicts the development of the superweapon, the Death Star, as well as diving deeper into the politics that comes after the Clone Wars and how people are beginning to feel after the Empire took over. Another movie, Solo, paints Han Solo’s past and explains why a seemingly random smuggler in the original trilogy such an asset is and shows a bit of his reluctancy to become a hero. It also shows why him, and Chewie are so loyal to each other. The Star Wars story is even stretched out in comic books and video games. Video games such as Star Wars: Battlefront II and Star Wars: Fallen Order show the effects of people’s lives during the Galactic Civil War. Fallen Orders follows a teenager who faces sudden death because he is now exposed as a person of interest because he is a Jedi, who are on the hunt after the collapse of the Republic. Battlefront II follows an Imperial defector who seeks to atone for her sins for aiding and abetting in the destruction of countless star systems as a pawn of the Empire. There are now shows such as The Mandalorian and the Book of Boba Fett, which are new additions to the Star Wars story. The Mandalorian works great as a standalone story. However, Star Wars fans that have followed the lore since the very beginning will understand why things are. For example, seasoned fans will understand why the galaxy is like the wild west, and what Mandalorians are (because they are introduced and explained in Star Wars: Clone Wars). They will also understand certain references mentioned in the show that are very well hidden in other media. For example, there’s a scene that mentions Operation Cinder. However, a casual fan wouldn’t know what Operation Cinder is because it is exclusively mentioned in Battlefront II. For those who get the reference, they will begin to realize how big of a world Star Wars really is. This is the source of inspiration for this. Picking up a show like The Mandalorian is like reading a random chapter from a book. Maybe you will get lucky and get a good story out of one chapter out of many. However, without a direct reference and timeline of what is going on in the universe, eventually you will get stuck. Additionally, there are much more complex concepts that must be shared to experience this series fully. This includes the concept of the Jedi religion, the fall of Mandalore, the rareness of Grogu’s species and what that means for the Star Wars universe.  All this falls into the Star Wars lore. The one way I feel that this can be bridged is through a complete and cohesive timeline. Of course, the timeline will start where it all begins, in my opinion: the prequel trilogy. From there, a web of lore can sprout and be created until we finish into the sequel trilogy, where it all comes together. This will be done in abridged summaries of each event, and even simplified graphics to help the reader understand what is going on. Perhaps like a library or a database but created as a storyline. In theory, this sounds like a great idea. However, the challenge is creating a story without making it seem like a database or an encyclopedia. One fluid story, because that’s what Star Wars is.
